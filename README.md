# Plant Leaf Disease Detection 🌱💻

A machine learning-based project that detects diseases in plant leaves using image classification techniques. This project aims to help farmers and plant enthusiasts identify diseases in plants at an early stage, reducing crop losses and improving plant health.

## Features 🚀
* **Disease Detection**: Detects diseases in plant leaves using image classification algorithms 🤖
* **Image Upload**: Allows users to upload images of plant leaves for disease detection 📸
* **Disease Identification**: Identifies the type of disease affecting the plant leaf, along with its severity level 🌟
* **Recommendations**: Provides recommendations for treating the disease and preventing its spread 🌿

## Technologies Used 💻
* **Python**: Programming language used for developing the project 🐍
* **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework used for building and training the model 🤖
* **OpenCV**: Library used for image processing and feature extraction 📚
* **Kaggle Dataset**: Dataset used for training and testing the model 🌟

## How it Works 🤔
1. **Image Upload**: User uploads an image of a plant leaf 📸
2. **Image Preprocessing**: Image is preprocessed to enhance its quality and remove noise 🖼
3. **Feature Extraction**: Features are extracted from the image using techniques such as texture analysis and color histogram 📊
4. **Model Prediction**: The preprocessed image is fed into the trained model, which predicts the type of disease affecting the plant leaf 🤖
5. **Disease Identification**: The predicted disease is identified, along with its severity level 🌟

## Code Structure 📂
* `app.py`: The main application file that handles image upload and disease detection 📁
* `model.py`: The file that defines and trains the deep learning model 🤖
* `utils.py`: The file that contains utility functions for image preprocessing and feature extraction 📚
